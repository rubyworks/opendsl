== Free as a bird. Think like a duck.

== DESCRIPTION

OpenDSL provides an open nomenclature for writing
domain specific instructions. The idea is inline
with the idea of duck-typing. You can allow domain
instructions to be given up front free of restriction,
then applying them later their correctness plays out
as they are utilized.

The library is especailly useful for plugins systems.


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see HISTORY file.


== SYNOPSIS

There are a few different ways in which this library can be
put to use, but the basic idea for all of them can be
demonstrated simply enough.

   Foo = OpenDSL.new do
     foo do
       'foo'
     end
   end

   class Something
     include Foo

     def foobar
       foo + 'bar'
     end
   end

OpenDSL.new creates a subclass of Module. Indeed, this library was
orginally called OpenModule, but the name was changed to focus
on it's utility, rather than it's implementation. Since an OpenDSL
object is a module you can use it just like any other module.


== HOW TO INSTALL

To install with RubyGems simply open a console and type:

  gem install opendsl

Site installation requires Setup.rb (gem install setup),
then download the tarball package and type:

  tar -xvzf openmodule-1.0.0.tgz
