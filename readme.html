<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>OpenDSL provides an open nomenclature for writing domain specific
instructions. The idea is inline with the idea of duck-typing. You can
allow domain instructions to be given up front free of restriction, then
applying them later their correctness plays out as they are utilized.</p>

<p>The library is especailly useful for plugins systems.</p>

<h2>RELEASE NOTES</h2>

<p>Please see HISTORY.rdoc file.</p>

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>

<p>There are a few different ways in which this library can be put to use, but
the basic idea for all of them can be demonstrated simply enough.</p>

<pre>Foo = OpenDSL.new do
  foo do
    'foo'
  end
end

class Something
  include Foo

  def foobar
    foo + 'bar'
  end
end</pre>

<p>OpenDSL.new creates a subclass of Module. Indeed, this library was
orginally called OpenModule, but the name was changed to focus on it’s
utility, rather than it’s implementation. Since an OpenDSL object is a
module you can use it just like any other module.</p>

<h2>HOW TO INSTALL</h2>

<p>To install with RubyGems simply open a console and type:</p>

<pre>gem install opendsl</pre>

<p>Site installation requires Setup.rb (gem install setup), then download the
tarball package and type:</p>

<pre>tar -xvzf openmodule-1.0.0.tgz
cd opendsl-1.0.0.tgz
sudo setup.rb all</pre>

<p>Windows users use ‘ruby setup.rb all’.</p>
