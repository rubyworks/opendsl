Require the OpenDSL library.

  require 'opendsl'

Create an OpenDSL module.

  Foo = OpenDSL.new do
    foo do
      'foo'
    end
  end

Apply it to a class.

  class Something
    include Foo

    def foobar
      foo + 'bar'
    end
  end

Verify it worked as expected.

  s = Something.new
  s.foobar.assert == 'foobar'
